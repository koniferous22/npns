# npns
Top-level repository

## Steps to run

1. clone the repository with submodules with `git clone --recursive <<REPO_URL>>` to get all necessary code
  * In case you process gets interrupted you can probably fix it somehow with `git submodule` commands, although I'd suggest removing files and starting again
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Have fun
